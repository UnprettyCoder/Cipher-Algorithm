There is "Ciphers" directory. Open it and go "src" dir.

There are several java files. "CipherTest.java" is runnning file and the others are Class files.

Try TEST and look at the Class files to figure out Simple Cipher Algorithms.

1. Ceasar's Cipher
2. Keyword Cipher
3. DoubleMap Cipher
4. Column Cipher
5. Column&Keyword Cipher
